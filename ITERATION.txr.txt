The feedback I received from the grader for p2 gold spike was mostly positive,
the only criticism being a buggy jump mechanic. After I resolved that issue,
I gathered more feedback from my friends. They mentioned the orb was too hard
to move in real time. To address this issue, I implemented a new mechanic to move
the orb; instead of moving the orb directly, the right stick now creates a "ghost"
of the orb which the player controls. It moves at a much faster speed than the orb
itself. The purpose of the ghost is that upon its creation, the orb will automatically
start heading towards the ghost, effectly allowing players to schedule the movement of
the orb. Another complaint was the lack of a sound effect when a player took damage.
It was added for p2 gold. The speed of the player character and the orb were adjusted
constantly to find the right balance.
